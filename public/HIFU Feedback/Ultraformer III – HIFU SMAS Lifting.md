# Non-surgical facelift

As skin loses elasticity, it‚Äôs natural to notice softening around the jawline, sagging cheeks, or a drooping brow. But not everyone is ready‚Äîor willing‚Äîfor a surgical solution.

That‚Äôs where the Ultraformer III comes in. This non-invasive HIFU treatment offers a non-surgical facelift with natural-looking results, zero downtime, and long-lasting collagen stimulation.

## What makes it different?

Ultraformer III uses high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to target deep beneath the surface of the skin‚Äîall the way to the SMAS layer, the same structure tightened in surgical facelifts.

The treatment delivers thermal energy to precise depths, triggering a healing response that lifts and firms the skin over time. No needles, no scalpels, and no downtime.

Unlike surface-level treatments, HIFU reaches foundational tissues without damaging the outer layer. It‚Äôs ideal for those looking to redefine their jawline, lift sagging cheeks, or tighten loose skin around the eyes or neck.
